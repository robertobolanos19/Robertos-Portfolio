                A senior in highschool from New Jersey. I’ve discovered a passion for Web Design and 3D Modeling during my junior year. I enjoy studying and practicing these subjects outside of classes. During the entirety of my  junior year’s summer, I’ve attended different courses to learn about the structure of Web Pages. I've received a Responsive Web Developer Certification for completing a 300 hour course. In my pastimes I enjoy biking down steep hills and socializing with people about things outside of the box.

                Growing up I’d always be inspired by games and the internet and it many possibities, I come from an undocumented family background which has led to a rough start in life. My family was not able to attend college because of their education, and this led to them having jobs where they would often receive low income. Being able to go into college and study computer science is my goal that I’m striving towards, having the chance to be part of our future technology and a job that isn’t forced on myself is my motivation.
