            <p>Ever wonder why people make sites or 3D items or characters? Many view making these as a hobby but I view this as a great opportunity to express my creativity and what I am capable of making and testing my limits, But at times I'd believe I wouldn't be capable of doing something which would cause me to push myself even harder. I enjoy the motto "keep er goin" this is a term my friends and I would use even though some situations seemed impossible to get a good outcome, we would use this term to keep our heads up and to keep trying.</p>
            <p class="text2">I am a Web and 3D designer from West Orange, New Jersey. I enjoy viewing characters or real life objects and recreating them as 3D models, the bigger the project the more intriuged I become. The feeling of satifaction of a finished Web Design fills me with motivation to make more and try to one up the previous site. </p>
